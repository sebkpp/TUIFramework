 * @brief A filter reducing the output of a Vector3d channel, for example KinectJoint positions.
 *
 * <ul><li>
 * To reduce output, vectors with small differences should not be send. Therefore the limit <tt>farThreshold</tt> is set.
 * A new vector is transmitted only if the difference to the last transmitted vector is greater than the threshold.
 * </li><li>
 * Differences which are small, but steady should be transmitted nevertheless. Therefore differences are added up.
 * When the sum reaches the threshold a new vector is transmitted.
 * </li><li>
 * But if differences occur only casually, they should not sum up.
 * Therefore the sum is resetted if the last transmitted vector occurs again.
 * In which scope a vector is acknowledge to be the same, is limited by <tt>nearThreshold</tt>.
 * </li><li>
 * A whole new vector will be transmitted if one of its values triggers a new transmission.
 * </li><li>
 * One filter can handle several channels and memorizes the previous vector and the sum for each of them.
 * </li></ul>
